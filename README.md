# Identification and comparison of somatic antigen structures of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria from Morganellaceae family

## Introduction

Analysis of the functional organization of the O-antigen operons makes it possible to identify genes specific for each O-serogroup and use them both for molecular typing of strains and for identifying pathways of bacterial evolution.

The aim of this project is to identify and compare candidate O-antigen operons in bacteria of the Morganellaceae family with different levels of virulence.

Goals of the project:
* to find genes of O-antigen biosynthesis in the Providencia and Xenorhabdus species analyzing the literature;
* to analyze the quality of all Providencia assemblies available at NCBI (204 assemblies) and select the best one for each species;
* to create and test the pipeline for identifying, visualizing O-antigen operons;
* to compare candidate O-antigen operons in selected Providencia and Xenorhabdus species;
